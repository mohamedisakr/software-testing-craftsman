### Test cases for Boundary Value Analysis 4n + 1

### Test cases for Robust Boundary Value 6n + 1

### Test cases for Worst Case Boundary Value 5^n

### Test cases for Robust Worst Case Boundary 7^n

### we will always have the same # of weak equivalence class test cases as classes in the partition with the largest # of subsets

### Strong equivalence class testing is based on the multiple fault assumption, so we need test cases from each element of the Cartesian product of the equivalence classes
